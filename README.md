## MCA, A Model School - Cardano Tools

### Musawenkosi Christian Academy ADA Donation
Cardano wallet connection and donation functionality makes use of the MeshJS library.

### Math Improvement Program

ADA will be held in escrow until a math score threshold is met by the class, triggering fulfillment of the smart contract. At that point, funds will be distributed to parties as outlined below. If the score threshold is not met within 30 days, funds return to the donor.

Current triggering score threshold: 58%

An interface to fund the escrow account will be required.

**Phase 1**
Escrow funded by Ed.

**Phase 2**
Escrow funded by donors.

Donor notified when contract expires or is fulfilled.

An interface to enter the math scores will be required. This will also save the entries to a database so progress can be tracked in future functionality. The functionality will total the scores and compute an average.

Total reward distributed will be the ADA equivalent of 1000 rand (currently ~142 ADA).

#### Funds Distribution
05% - math teacher (Stephen)
10% - divided among 5x iTeam assistants (2% ea.)
80% - divided among 25x students (3.2% ea.)
05% - MCA Treasury

### Donation

Donor connects wallet, specifies amount and submits donation.
Donation is held in escrow until the condition is met.
Funds will be distributed monthly upon verification of fulfillment of the obligation until funds are expended.
Currently, the distributions are scheduled over a five-month period in increments of 20% of the total donation.
*For testing purposes, the remaining amount is returned rather than waiting for the five month period.
